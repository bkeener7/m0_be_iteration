# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

I was confused at first, but it ended up clicking after trying several different examples and I feel great about it now.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I did this later in the day during my typically less productive time period, so coming across a difficult concept took longer than normal to understand. However I did not feel unproductive. Patience paid off after going through several examples and it clicked on the 4th one.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I feel confident in this concept.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I do not currently have any questions.
